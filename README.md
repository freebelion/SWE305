# SWE305 C# Programming

- This project contains the instructor's examples which may help the students.
- Students can also make use of many other tutotials found all over the web, such as:
  - [C# Tutorial on **W3Schools.com**](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/index.php).
  - [C# Guide on **Microsoft.com**](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/)
  
  *The website on the first link gives the option to autotranslate the contents.
  The second website will directly open with translated content, depending on the viewer's language choices.*

Let's start with some theoretical background:

- C# is a programming language created by Microsoft.
- It is an object-oriented programming language built on C++, with the addition of some useful features from other popular languages.
- It is an easy-to-learn language which is useful to learn, because it leaves out the unsafe features of C++, while it is not as restrictive as Java.
- C# itself does not require installation, but you will need install a current version of .NET on Windows (dotnet on Linux) to run the code you have written with C#.
- Also installing a code editor will help your development work easier.
  - You can install Visual Studio Community edition on Windows,
  - or you can install VS Code on the operating system you prefer.
  
  *On VS Code, you will need to install an extension which will help you code and compile ith C#.*
